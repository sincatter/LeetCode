## Introdution
Implement <code>int sqrt(int x)</code>.  
Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.  
Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.
### Example 1:
__Input__: 4  
__Output__: 2  
### Example 2:
__Input__: 8  
__Output__: 2  
__Explanation__: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
